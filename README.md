Prog209 - HW 7 Finish your jQuery Mobile client side app 
Due Monday by 11:59pm Points 10 Submitting a text entry box or a file upload
Before we move on to hosting your client app on a server, your team needs to finish the requirements for your client app.

You and your partner should pick an app, most likely the on that one of you submitted for homework 2 weeks ago (but if you want to start all over, that's ok)  Which ever one of you that has the GitHub site should go there and add your new partner as a contributor.  That homework had these requirements, which carry forward:

have 3 "pages", each with the header, content and footnote sections, as well as a NavBar
home page should describe what the web site does
another page should let a user enter data, must have at least 4 pieces of data, at least one of which is selected with a drop down Select element
this data should be collected and stored in an object making use of an object constructor function, and stored in an array.
3rd page should display the data. It should use a pagebeforeshow  event so that when the user navigates to this page, the data is shown automatically, no buttons.
Your header and footer's should have some kind of image consistent with the theme of the web site.
Use the data-theme='e', with some interesting mic of a, b, c, d, or e for each of the 3 sections on the 3 pages
Here are the final requirements for this course project, I have bolded the parts that should be extended for this homework beyond what you did in the last one:

Prog 209 – Course Project #1  jQuery mobile app served from node.js

To get full credit for this project, your code should:

1- use jQuery Mobile to construct a SPA (single page application)

2- use the theme roller to create a colorful interface

3- be served from a node.js server  (maybe, not sure yet, which is hosted on Azure (this means your friends can run your app on their phone)

4 - have a welcome page that makes it clear what the site does and at least 3 other pages

5 - the 3 other pages must all base part of their functionality on some common data that is accessed on each of the 3 pages. This data must also be stored and accessed as "master data" on the node server.

6- the application must be "interesting" and/or “useful”, and not trivial.  I will be the judge of that – we should be able to clear that up with the prior homework where you submitted your ideas and screen drawings.

It must have at least one ul with active li’s.  See this WORD doc   Making_li_elments active buttons.docx                  and this zoom vid  Prog209-I-jQueryActive_li_elements.mp4      You can also look at my Movies app for an example.

7- You must demo your app to the class during final's week.

One member of the team should submit a GitHub link
